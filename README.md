Did you ever forget where you have your next remote lecture?

Did you forget that you have one more labs before you can go cook dinner?

##### This app should be just for you.

- Highlights the current block to help you get around more easily
- Easy templating current blocks (you can copy it, change a bit and place somewhere else)
- Works offline
- In just 1 file (ease of use and ease of sharing)
- No engines, no servers, just HTML, CSS and JS
- Dark mode
